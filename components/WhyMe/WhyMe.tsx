      <h1>Why Me?</h1>
      <p>
        With the current environment of work from home and learn from home,
        there are more tutor services available than ever. So why should you
        choose me over the other options?
      </p>
      <h2>More Than Just Tutoring</h2>
      <p>
        Students learn in a variety of ways. I believe that learning works best
        when people have access to all the resources they could need when
        getting started. Because of this philosophy, I've designed and continue
        to frequently update a large library of practice problems, topic
        explanations, and video lessons.
      </p>

      <p>
        While is no shortage of practice problems and videos available online,
        my students have the benefit of being able to go over this material with
        me during sessions, or doing it on their own time and having me grade
        this material for them.
      </p>

      <h2>Expert Knowledge</h2>
      <p>
        You deserve the best out of your tutoring sessions. This is why I have
        not only acquired a Bachelor's degree in mathematics, but continue to
        learn and update my skillset so as to better serve my students. I
        believe that an understanding of higher level materials on my end will
        better facilitate learning of lower level materials for the student.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course, tutoring is in and of itself a skill, which takes time and
        patience to learn. During my time at Dutchess Community College I
        tutored over three semesters and helped as a teaching assistant over the
        summer. I continue to learn this as well with the aim of being the best
        tutor I can possibly be.
      </p>

      <h2>Available & Affordable</h2>
      <p>
        I understand that with the ongoing pandemic budgets are stretched thin
        and schedules are unconventional. With this in mind I've gone to great
        lengths to ensure that I'm available to my students when they need me,
        even on short notice, and that my prices are affordable for those who
        need my assistance.
