        Perhaps the most interesting effect the pandemic has had has to do with
        the economic landscape. Certain industries, such as hospitality and
        physical services, have suffered over the past year. Others, such as the
        online technology sectors, have never done better. To note this, all you
        have to do is look at the stock prices of companies such as Netflix and
        Amazon.

        I own an online tutoring business, so I’m most interested in the effect
        the pandemic will have on services like mine. The result of online
        learning has been to greatly increase demand for online one-on-one
        tutoring. However, the real question is whether or not this heightened
        demand will hold in the coming months. Is this merely a temporary shift,
        and once students are back in their normal classroom setting it will
        fade into the background once again? Or is it representative of a larger
        change in how people approach their education?
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        The truth is, it’s difficult to say exactly what will happen in the
        future. If there’s one thing this pandemic has proven, it’s that trying
        to figure out exactly where the future leads is doomed to failure. We
        simply can’t predict what’s going to occur in a month or a year.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        What is fair to say is that we’re well on our way back to some semblance
        of normalcy. It’s just that after more than a year of the virus, what
        “normal” means exactly remains to be seen.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        The United States is currently at a rate of about 17 vaccination doses
        per 100 people, and we’re administering around 0.5 per 100 people per
        day. In other words, millions of people are getting vaccinated every
        day, which is incredibly hopeful. We’re also more than halfway through
        the school year, and so there’s good reason to believe that by the fall
        we’ll all be back in classrooms going about our education normally.
      </p>

        To a certain extent, however, this is exactly why I believe tutoring is
        here to stay for a while. If you haven’t already, check out our article{" "}
        <Link href="/blog/math-in-the-pandemic">
          <a className={styles.link}>Mathematics in the Pandemic</a>
        </Link>
        . In it we explore the fact that the mathematical education of many
        students is currently suffering.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        Plenty of schools have been only offering distance-learning over the
        past few months, and of the ones that are doing in-person schooling most
        are operating at a reduced capacity, or with unusual schedules. The end
        result has been irregular studying and lower test scores. This is
        especially pronounced amongst minority groups and those who don’t attend
        wealthy private schools.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        It may be that as we all go back to school in the fall, students will
        need the extra help to get caught back up to speed. While some schools
        are likely to offer summer programs to help their students catch up,
        many will continue grappling with the effects of the pandemic. Summer
        break, coupled with this difficult spring and past fall semester, are
        probably only going to exacerbate the problem.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        In this way, tutoring will be not only important but essential to get
        mathematics students all over the world back up to speed with their
        studies. If this service doesn’t rise to the occasion, it’s likely that
        many of these students will not make the grades necessary to get into
        their college of choice.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        While it is difficult to predict exactly how tutoring will expand as a
        business in the future, we can look to how it’s doing right now and make
        some inferences. In 2020 alone, 1.4 billion students across the world
        were impacted by the pandemic. These were children and young adults out
        of school, home from college, and trying to cope with online learning.
        Their teachers had to adapt rapidly, and so there was plenty of
        confusion as a result. Students got lost in the process, and they felt
        forced to seek outside help in the form of online and in-person
        tutoring.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        There are some good reasons to believe that the future of online
        tutoring is a bright one. Just as the film industry has now had a chance
        to test the otherwise unlikely idea of sending blockbuster movies
        straight to streaming platforms, the education industry has had the
        opportunity to see how well internet tutoring works for their students.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        It’s fair to say that the education industry is a fairly conservative
        one, and isn’t always necessarily at the forefront of innovation.
        However, if this system of tutoring proves to be successful, we can
        expect to see educators push their struggling students towards this
        avenue in the future.
      </p>
      <div className={styles.image_block}>

          className={styles.image}

        />
      </div>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        The alternative possibility here is, of course, that online tutoring
        isn’t nearly as effective as we would have hoped. In this case, however
        unlikely it is, there might be further resistance to online tutoring in
        the future. In either case, parents and teachers will draw conclusions
        about the value of tutoring as a whole for their students.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        Still, this is an unlikely result. There is hope that online tutoring is
        here to stay, and will grow in future months and years far beyond where
        it was only a few years ago. The truth is, many parents find the
        offerings of internet tutoring highly attractive. This method of
        instruction promises students personalized instruction, more practice
        beyond school hours, highly-qualified and certified tutors, fewer
        distractions while students study, and so on.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        Many tutoring companies also provide test preparation services for exams
        such as the SAT and ACT, and course materials so the students can have a
        more diverse range of documents to study from. Our company, Functional
        Tutoring, is no exception here, and we’re putting a huge amount of
        effort into building out our library for our students.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        There are other reasons for the growth of the tutoring sector beyond the
        pandemic. Because our world is becoming more and more globalized,
        competition to get into some of the most competitive universities is
        getting fierce. Where getting into a top college used to be a matter of
        obtaining high grades and participating in an extracurricular or two,
        now you need college credits, several extracurriculars, community
        service, and unique experiences to separate you out from the crowd.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        It’s no longer enough to be good: now you have to be perfect. We
        perceive education as an investment into ourselves, and so there is an
        almost survival imperative to get into a good college or university.
      </p>
      <div className={styles.image_block}>
        <img
          src={university}
          className={styles.image}
          alt="Three students chatting in front of NYU flags on white building."
        />
      </div>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        Because education has become so competitive, parents are looking for
        ways to push their children to do better. The obvious first way to get
        higher grades is to hire a tutor. Online companies offering this kind of
        service are investing billions of dollars each year into improving the
        skills of their tutors, adding quality content, and doing research to
        better understand the needs of their students.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        A common misconception is that it’s only the wealthy private school
        attendees that are seeking online tutoring. Actually, it can be in part
        due to the inadequacy of their public schools that many parents are
        turning to online help. Because internet tutoring is now so affordable,
        it makes sense for many of these parents and their children to go in
        this direction rather than pay tens of thousands per year to attend a
        private school, even when this public school is woefully underfunded and
        understaffed.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        You can see that there are many reasons why online tutoring is likely to
        grow in the coming months and years. Now all that remains is to see what
        happens and hope that the end result is good for everyone involved.
